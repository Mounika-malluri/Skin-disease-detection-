# Skin Disease Detection 🩺✨

A machine learning model to analyze skin lesion images and classify them into various disease categories (e.g., melanoma, benign, etc.). Built with Python and TensorFlow/Keras to aid in early diagnosis support.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement  
Skin cancer and related conditions can be hard to diagnose visually. This project aims to leverage deep learning to assist dermatologists by providing an automated classification system for dermoscopic images.

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow & Keras  
- OpenCV / PIL for image preprocessing  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualizations  
- Jupyter Notebook
