This project uses deep learning (CNN) to detect and classify various skin diseases at an early stage.

## Features
- Built with TensorFlow and Keras
- Trained on a skin disease dataset (include source if public)
- Predicts disease type from an input image
- Can be integrated into a real-time mobile/desktop application

## Tools Used
- Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy
- Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the notebook and follow the steps

## Results
